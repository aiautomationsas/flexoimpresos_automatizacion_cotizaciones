General Observations:
Monolithic Structure: The entire application logic seems to be contained within this single, very large file (app_calculadora_costos.py). This makes the code difficult to navigate, understand, maintain, and test.
Mixing Concerns: The file mixes UI logic (Streamlit widgets, layout, CSS), business logic (calculations, data processing), database interactions, authentication, and PDF generation. This violates the principle of Separation of Concerns.
Heavy Reliance on st.session_state: While necessary in Streamlit, extensive use of st.session_state for nearly everything can make data flow hard to track and debug.
Global State/Side Effects: Functions like inicializar_cotizacion, cargar_datos_cliente, etc., seem to modify st.session_state directly, creating implicit dependencies and potential side effects that are hard to manage.
Repetitive Code: There seems to be repetition, especially in UI element creation and data handling within different sections (e.g., main, mostrar_calculadora, mostrar_cotizacion).
Constants: While some constants are defined in constants.py, many magic numbers and strings are likely still present within the functions (e.g., CSS styles, keys for dictionaries/session state).
Error Handling: While there's some try-except usage (e.g., in extraer_valor_precio), it could be more robust and consistent throughout the application, especially around database operations and calculations.
Testing: The current structure makes unit and integration testing very challenging.
Specific Suggestions for Improvement:
Modularization:
Break down app_calculadora_costos.py: Create separate Python modules/files for distinct functionalities:
ui.py: Functions responsible for creating Streamlit UI components (e.g., functions like mostrar_calculadora, mostrar_cotizacion, crear_login_ui could be refactored and moved here).
logic.py or calculations.py: Core business logic, calculations (like CalculadoraCostosEscala, CalculadoraLitografia seem to be already separated, which is good, but helper functions like procesar_escalas, generar_tabla_resultados, generar_informe_tecnico could potentially live here or in a dedicated reporting module).
database.py or data_access.py: Consolidate all database interactions (currently handled by DBManager and direct Supabase calls). Abstract away the specifics of Supabase if possible.
auth.py: Move authentication logic (AuthManager interactions) here.
pdf.py: Move PDF generation logic (CotizacionPDF, MaterialesPDF) here.
models.py or schemas.py: Define data structures (like the dataclasses and potentially Pydantic models for validation) used throughout the application. The existing model_classes directory seems like a good start, but ensure consistency.
utils.py: For general utility functions like extraer_valor_precio.
config.py: For application configuration (though st.secrets is handling some of this).
Main app.py: The main script should primarily orchestrate the application flow, initialize necessary components, handle routing between "pages" or sections, and call functions from the other modules.
Refactor State Management:
Minimize st.session_state Scope: Instead of storing everything in st.session_state, use it primarily for UI state and essential application-level state (like authentication status, current user, selected quote ID).
Pass Data Explicitly: Refactor functions to accept necessary data as arguments and return results, rather than relying on finding data in st.session_state. This improves clarity and testability.
Use Objects/Classes: Encapsulate related state and behavior within classes. The existing Calculadora..., DBManager, AuthManager, and CotizacionModel are good steps in this direction. Ensure they are well-defined and manage their own internal state where appropriate.
Improve Code Readability and Maintainability:
Function Length: Break down very long functions (like mostrar_calculadora and mostrar_cotizacion likely are, based on the outline) into smaller, single-purpose functions.
Naming Conventions: Ensure consistent and descriptive naming for variables, functions, and classes.
Type Hinting: Add type hints consistently (typing module) to improve code understanding and enable static analysis. You are already using it in some places, which is great - make it universal.
Docstrings: Write clear docstrings for all functions and classes explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
Remove Redundancy: Identify and consolidate repeated code blocks into reusable functions or classes.
Externalize CSS: Move the CSS currently embedded in Markdown strings into a separate .css file and load it using st.markdown(f'<style>{css_content}</style>', unsafe_allow_html=True) after reading the file content. This cleans up the Python code.
Enhance Business Logic/Calculations:
Input Validation: Add robust validation for all user inputs (e.g., dimensions, quantities, selections) before they are used in calculations or saved to the database. Consider using libraries like Pydantic for data validation.
Calculation Transparency: Ensure the calculation logic (especially within CalculadoraCostosEscala and CalculadoraLitografia) is clear and well-documented. Consider adding options for users to see how a price was derived (intermediate steps).
Configuration Management: Make key calculation parameters (like waste percentages, machine speeds, margins) easily configurable, potentially through a separate config file or an admin interface, rather than hardcoding them (even if they are in constants.py, consider if they might need to be adjusted without code changes).
Database Interaction:
Abstraction: Ensure DBManager provides a clear abstraction layer over Supabase. Avoid direct Supabase calls scattered throughout the UI or logic code.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling for all database operations (reads, writes, updates, deletes). Inform the user appropriately if an operation fails.
Transactions: Use database transactions where multiple related database operations need to succeed or fail together (e.g., when saving a quote with multiple scales).
Testing Strategy:
Unit Tests: With modularization, you can write unit tests for individual functions, especially the calculation logic, utility functions, and data transformation functions.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different modules (e.g., UI calling logic, logic interacting with the database).
End-to-End Tests: Consider tools like streamlit-book or Selenium-based frameworks to test the user interface flow.
Consejos Adicionales para la App (Cotizador de Litografía):
Visualización de Costos: Consider adding charts (e.g., using st.line_chart, st.bar_chart) to visualize how costs break down (materials, labor, setup, etc.) or how unit price changes with scale.
Gestión de Clientes y Referencias: Enhance the UI/UX for managing clients and their specific product references. Allow searching, filtering, and easy selection.
Historial de Cotizaciones: Implement a robust way to view, search, and potentially clone or revise past quotes. The mostrar_actualizar_cotizacion function seems to hint at this, but ensure it's user-friendly.
Gestión de Materiales/Insumos: If material prices fluctuate, consider adding a section to manage base materials, inks, finishes, and their current costs. This would centralize cost updates.
Permisos y Roles: If multiple users (e.g., sales reps, managers) use the app, refine the role-based access control (building on AuthManager). Managers might need to see all quotes or approve certain discounts.
Interfaz de Usuario (UI/UX):
Workflow: Guide the user logically through the quoting process step-by-step. Use st.expander or tabs (st.tabs) to organize complex input sections.
Feedback: Provide clear feedback during calculations (e.g., spinners using st.spinner) and after actions (e.g., success/error messages using st.success/st.error).
Defaults: Set sensible defaults for common inputs to speed up the quoting process.
Exportación/Compartir: Beyond PDF generation, consider options to export quote data to CSV/Excel or share a unique link to a quote (potentially read-only).
Próximos Pasos:
Prioritize: Start with the most critical refactoring: breaking the monolithic app_calculadora_costos.py into smaller, focused modules (UI, Logic, Data Access, Auth).
Refactor Incrementally: Don't try to rewrite everything at once. Refactor one module or one piece of functionality at a time, ensuring the app still works after each step.
Add Tests: Start writing tests for the newly refactored, isolated components, especially the business logic.
This is a significant undertaking, but breaking down the application into more manageable parts will greatly improve its long-term health, maintainability, and extensibility. Would you like me to start by suggesting how to structure the project directory and begin refactoring a specific part, like separating the UI components?
